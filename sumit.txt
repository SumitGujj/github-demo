Kabaddi is a contact team sport[2] with origins in Ancient India.[3] 
Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, touch out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, 
all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath.[4] 
Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider.
Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled,
but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tags or tackle.
It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. 
Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 
20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh.[5] It is the state game of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu,
 Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, 
and Uttar Pradesh.[6]
